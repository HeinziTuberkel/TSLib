Tailor Ware 0.5 (TSLib) is a component and function library made by me.
It's free to use or change for anyone, either private, educational or commercial.
On the other hand I don't take any responsibility for any errors or strange behaviour ("special features" <g>)
you might encounter.

To install it in Lazarus (I used 1.2.4 with FPC 2.6.4 to make it) the following packages 
should be installed (dependencies):
- SQLDBLaz 1.0.1
- zcore 7.0 (free ZEOS database components)
- LCL 1.0
- FCL 1.0
You may be able to install / use it without the ZEOS core if you edit the file "tailorware_defines.inc"
and remove the line {$define USEZEOS}, but I have not yet testet it enough to be sure that it works.

Now to the contents:
It contains some components or controls, that (until now) don't do anything special. I just created
them as descendants from the original LCL-components so I can add functionality in the future.
When that happens, I only have to recompile my applications and voila, they use the new features.

There are several library files (<something>lib.pp) containing mainly conversion functions I missed before.

The main components are the "TSConfigStorage" components and the "TSDBGrid" control.

----------- TSConfigStorage  --------------

The TSConfigStorage's all descend from TTSConfigStorage and can be used to store values of 
several types (Boolean, TColor, Integer, Dates, Strings, TStrings) and associate them with a storage name.
The several descendants (TTSINIConfigStorage, TTSDBConfigStorage, TTSDatasetConfigStorage, 
TTSSQLConfigStorage, TTSZSQLConfigStorage) can store and retrieve these values to/from different storages.
Not much new to that - INI-Files, XML-INI, Registry-INI etc.
The main difference is, that these components 
a) can be added to a form at design time and the values can be edited with the object inspector
b) can begin to work (almost) without effort:
	If you add TTSINIConfigStorage and don't change anything you can still call 
		MyForm.Color := TTSINIConfigStorage1.Color['FormBackground'];
	The result is not very useable, since the form would then have the color "clNone", but the 
	component automatically creates an INI file with name of the application and writes a value
	"FormBackground=clNone" to that file. 
	That way you can already change your applications properties through that INI-File.
	
	
----------- TSDBGrid  --------------
This is a direct descendant from TDBGrid.

It adds functionality to
- sort the grid data by any column
- filter the grid data
- set several grid options a run time on a "GridOptionsForm"

Since I'm tired of writing, you'll have to try yourself or wait until this file is updated....
